## Comments on the project and its development:
* The application is currently working with basic functionalities. Users can signup, signin and signout. Users can see products, add them to their lists and proceed to checkout.
* Working in a team was a different experience to us. We could achieve more because we split tasks but also we got involved in less processes.
